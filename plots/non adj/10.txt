it looks like ronda rousey is officially blazing the comeback trail as she gets back in the gym for the first documented session with her coaches since a november 2015 loss to holly holm
<unk> no telling if <unk> had any private training sessions since the fight with holm, but from the kind of schedule <unk> been keeping outside the cage, rousey has been very busy
it was actually filming <unk> <unk> that forced rousey to make the call that she would be unable to return at ufc 200 in july for a rematch with holm
the ufc ultimately decided to scrap that plan all together and put holm in a title fight against <unk> tate instead at ufc 196 on march 5

from the look of things, rousey is at least starting to get fight ready for her eventual return to the ufc later this year
