in a large new analysis of more than 2,000 popular recipes, data scientists have discovered perhaps the key reason why indian food tastes so unique: it does something radical with flavours, something very different from what we tend to do in the united states and the rest of western culture
popular food pairings in this part of the world combine ingredients that share like flavours, which food chemists have broken down into their molecular parts <unk> precise chemical compounds that, when combined, give off a distinct taste
most of the compounds have scientific names, though one of the simpler compounds is <unk> which, as the food chemist george <unk> has written, is <unk> pleasant, and (has a) <unk> <unk>
a chart shared by scientific american in 2013 shows which foods share the most flavour compounds with others and which food pairings have the most flavour compounds in common
milk, butter, bread and rice, meanwhile <unk> all of which are hallmarks of western cuisine <unk> were found to be associated with just the opposite: flavour pairings that match
but there are connections that are more difficult to <unk> strawberries, for instance, have more in common with white wine than they do with apples, oranges or honey
the <unk> cuisine and its mix of spices is more often than not a revelation for those who sit down to eat it for the first time
more specifically, many indian recipes contain cayenne, the basis of curry powder that is in dishes such as red curry, green curry, or <unk> curry
but behind the appeal of indian food <unk> what makes it so novel and so delicious <unk> is also a stranger and subtler truth
<unk> of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavour sharing pattern with rest of the <unk> the researchers noted
in other words, the more overlap two ingredients have in <unk> the less likely they are to appear in the same indian dish
researchers at the indian institute for technology in jodhpur crunched data on several thousand recipes from a popular online recipe site called <unk>
when any of those ingredients appeared in an indian dish, there was a good chance there would be a lot of flavour overlap
the same can be said of green bell pepper, <unk> and garam masala, which are nearly as ubiquitous in indian cuisine
they looked at how much the underlying flavour compounds overlapped in single dishes and discovered something very different from western cuisines
if you were to hold a microscope to most western dishes, you would find an interesting but not <unk> trend
the take-away is that part of what makes indian food unique is the way flavours rub up against each other
many asian cuisines have been shown to belie the trend by favouring dishes with ingredients that <unk> overlap in flavour
and when a dish contains cayenne, the researchers found, <unk> unlikely to have other ingredients that share similar flavours
they broke each dish down to its ingredients, and then compared how often and heavily ingredients share flavour compounds
before we go further, <unk> take a step back and consider what flavours are and how they interact
but all those ingredients are important because in any single dish, each one brings its own flavour
the cuisine is complicated, no doubt: the average indian dish, after all, contains at least seven ingredients
<unk> found that average flavour sharing in indian cuisine was significantly lesser than <unk> the researchers wrote
peanut butter and roasted peanuts have one of the most significant overlaps (no surprise there)
together, they help form the pillars of what tastes so good to so many people
indian food, with its hodgepodge of ingredients and intoxicating aromas, is coveted around the world
chefs in the west like to make dishes with ingredients that have overlapping flavours
<unk> it can be found in whiskey, apple juice, orange juice and raw beets
heavy doses of cardamom, cayenne, <unk> and other flavours can overwhelm an unfamiliar palate
on average, there are just over 50 flavour compounds in each food ingredient
the researchers examined several thousand recipes, which used a total of 200 ingredients
and indian food, in particular, is one of the most powerful <unk>
indian cuisine tended to mix ingredients whose flavours <unk> overlap at all
but not all cuisines adhere to the same rule
and it does it at the molecular level
the answer? not too often
