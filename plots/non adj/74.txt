at a news conference on wednesday, john hawks of the university of wisconsin, madison, a senior author of the paper describing the new species, said it was <unk> any other species seen <unk> noting that a small skull with a brain one-third the size of modern human <unk> was perched
in two papers published this week in the open-access journal <unk> the researchers said that the more than 1,550 fossil elements documenting the discovery constituted the largest sample for any <unk> species in a single african site, and one of the largest anywhere in the world
berger said: <unk> do believe that the field of paleoanthropology had convinced itself, as much as 15 years ago, that we had found everything, that we were not going to make major discoveries and had this story of our origins figured out
<unk> <unk> besides introducing a new member of the <unk> family, the discovery suggests that some early <unk> intentionally deposited bodies of their dead in a remote and largely inaccessible cave chamber, a behavior previously considered limited to modern humans
in an accompanying commentary in the journal, chris stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the natural history museum in london, found overall similarities between the new species and fossils from <unk> in the former soviet republic of georgia, dated to about 1

in addition to the journal articles, the findings will be featured in the october issue of national geographic magazine and in a two-hour <unk> geographic documentary to air wednesday on pbs

further, the scientists said, that sample is probably a small fraction of the fossils yet to be recovered from the chamber
