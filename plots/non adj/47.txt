refugee support initiatives such as lifeline syria say allowing donors to receive a tax receipt when they are donating to a registered charity and suggesting a particular family to receive support would encourage more donations, ease the <unk> burden and make integration easier
although money given to a registered refugee charity is normally tax deductible, blumberg says the situation becomes more tricky when a donor instructs the money should go to a specific person or family, sometimes referred to as a <unk> <unk> or <unk> gift
<unk> in other words: it cannot issue a tax receipt if a donor wants the charity to give the funds to a specified person or family, because <unk> a gift is made to the person or family and not to the charity
as the toronto office of lifeline syria scrambles to accommodate thousands of refugees, the question the <unk> chair ratna <unk> and her team hears most often is: <unk> i get a tax <unk> <unk> in many cases, the answer is no
<unk> donations made by the family would be excluded from a charitable receipt because the recipient would not be at <unk> length from the <unk> says donald smith, chair of the refugee working group at the anglican diocese of ottawa
for example, a <unk> <unk> to use the gift for a <unk> <unk> is acceptable, provided <unk> benefit <unk> to the <unk> and the gift <unk> not benefit any person not dealing at <unk> length with the donor
immigration and citizenship defines <unk> as five or more canadian citizens or permanent residents with the financial means to be a sponsor, the ability to provide emotional and social support and living in the <unk> expected community
currently, charities can issue tax receipts to donors who indicate <unk> like their donation applied to a specific area of interest, such as refugees, but not when the donation is directed to a particular family
<unk> far the anglican diocese has not refused any partnerships for lack of capacity, but we are probably approaching our limit if we <unk> get financial support to take on more <unk> says smith
<unk> canadians, we are used to the notion that when we make a charitable donation, <unk> will get some kind of tax <unk> says paul clarke, executive director of action <unk> <unk>
<unk> more canadians step up and promote charities, the less the government is going to have to do these <unk> says estelle <unk> a tax lawyer at <unk> weinstein in ottawa
the advantageous nature of partnerships with <unk> is leading to overworked charities and <unk> and many of those in the field say <unk> creating bottlenecks in the sponsorship process
however, a group depending on a partnership with a <unk> because it does not have the financial means to form a group of five may not meet those criteria
and organizations cannot take on a project unless it fits their core mandate as they are responsible for the use of funds for which they issue tax receipts
mark <unk> a toronto lawyer who specializes in non-profit and charity law, says the canada revenue agency could make donating and sponsoring easier by clarifying the rules
once associated with a sponsorship agreement holder <unk> these community groups become constituent groups <unk> allowing them to sponsor one or more refugees with the <unk> support
<unk> <unk> moreover, <unk> may be unable to receive tax receipts when they make a donation to a registered charity to help the family they are sponsoring
<unk> are based in the sponsored <unk> expected community of settlement and, unlike <unk> must have their sponsorship application and settlement plan approved by a <unk>
if it is a registered charity, and if refugee sponsorship is a part of its mission or mandate, the community sponsor can issue a charitable receipt
another problem, according to <unk> is that so-called groups of five, known as <unk> cannot issue tax receipts to supporters because they are not registered charities
he says despite the extraordinary support canadians have shown for syrian refugees to date, questions around tax deductibility dissuade some people from sponsorship
the estimated total annual settlement cost for one refugee is <unk> which does not include in-kind expenses, such as shelter, clothing and furniture
the canadian council for <unk> executive director janet dench says her charity has been contacted by <unk> wanting to do just that
<unk> why many community groups are looking to sponsor refugees in partnership with the holder of a sponsorship agreement with ottawa
<unk> <unk> the <unk> position is that <unk> decisions regarding use of the donation must rest with the charity
since last august, the number of constituent groups under the <unk> wing has jumped from 11 to 50
<unk> <unk> <unk> everyone else in the sponsorship community <unk> been working seven days a <unk> he says
<unk> doubt anyone has a clear idea of how many refugees have been sponsored by <unk> to date
canada has so far welcomed more than 13,500 refugees since the liberal <unk> program began last november
if a g5 partners with an organization able to issue tax receipts, it can collect more donations
<unk> they do (get a tax <unk> people are more inclined to give larger <unk> says dench
in spite of these headaches, lifeline <unk> chair <unk> continues to encourage canadians to become refugee sponsors
says <unk> <unk> have to be careful about issuing charitable receipts for groups they partner with
<unk> <unk> if the <unk> provided greater leeway, <unk> be more people making <unk> says blumberg
the third class of sponsors are community sponsors, which can be organizations, associations or corporations
another barrier for <unk> is that they generally include canadian members of the <unk> family
but clearly it could be bigger if one could get clarity on <unk> she says
<unk> moreover, a <unk> might not have the resources to partner with the group
<unk> of five are the most generous but are treated the <unk> says blumberg
due to privacy reasons, only the <unk> knows who they are, says lawyer <unk>
he cites the partial <unk> of tuition costs at religious day schools
<unk> experience at the anglican diocese of ottawa is a cautionary tale
of that total, close to 5,000 have been supported by private sponsors
<unk> administrative burden can be quite a <unk> says dench
smith describes all the new <unk> as <unk>
<unk> <unk> exceptions add to the confusion
<unk> enthusiasm is huge
