internet services like netflix and youtube deliver video programming to screens large and small, in living rooms and on smartphones <unk> and it is sent <unk> the <unk> in industry jargon, via the internet, sidestepping the tv <unk> accustomed control point, the set-top box
the monitoring made possible by digital technology can be far more detailed <unk> down to the household level <unk> not only covering what is being watched but, when combined with other data sources, also predicting behavior and buying habits
<unk> <unk> on traditional television, major consumer product and brand advertisers want their ads to be shown alongside high-quality video programming, mainly the sitcoms and dramas the medium is known for, say the analysts and executives
<unk> internet was an example of what can be done, but now it is going to tv as <unk> said <unk> williams, president of <unk> an advertising technology start-up owned by the cox media group
<unk> will take on some of the characteristics of internet advertising in terms of targeting and relying on data to predict who is behind the <unk> said james <unk> an analyst at forrester research
today, google is pursuing a vision of <unk> ad delivery <unk> called <unk> tv <unk> but with a modified approach, portraying itself as a tools maker to assist content providers and marketers
those online video ads are only a tenth of the television ad market of $70 billion a year, but they are projected to grow 21 percent a year, according to forrester research
rick <unk> its general manager of audience solutions, views digital tv as another market for its targeting services, which are used in direct mail, telemarketing, email and online ads
the shares of the companies, including disney, 21st century fox, viacom and cbs, suffered as wall street saw a warning sign that madison avenue has recognized for some time
the tv industry wants to be able to target ads to households and individuals, as on the web, but without losing control of its distribution network and business
yet as tv embraces digital technology, it opens the door to targeting television ads as never before, much as is done with advertising on the web today
in 2012, google shut down its google tv ads unit after it made little headway in trying to adapt its internet marketplace model to selling television ads
those <unk> rate of buying the cars was more than 60 percent higher than that of a demographically similar control group who were not shown the ads
<unk> role, said <unk> ng, director of product management for video ads, is to <unk> data-driven buying and automation to how television and video advertising is bought
<unk> content is scarce, and scarcity creates a huge difference between tv and the <unk> said scott ferber, chief executive of <unk> an ad tech start-up
that helps explain the surge in digital video advertising on <unk> youtube, facebook and streaming services like hulu, where the rules of internet targeting apply
until recently, tv audience information used by advertisers has come mainly from samples of viewers and surveys, conducted by nielsen and other market research companies
the set-top box has long been <unk> technical gateway, and that technology is receiving a digital upgrade to give set-top boxes <unk> targeting capabilities
the tv market is fracturing and becoming less predictable, undermining the main appeal of traditional tv to <unk> its ability to deliver mass-market audiences
they are going to want to be in greater control over <unk> said bill day, chief executive of tremor video, an ad technology start-up
in the other apartment, a couple with two children and a weekend home might be shown an ad for a sport utility vehicle
<unk> <unk> in recent years, video ad tech start-ups have <unk> typically specializing in working with the big media companies or ad buyers
this bedrock principle of media advertising is working against the television industry today, as new viewing patterns challenge old ways of doing business
the future of tv advertising may be more like web advertising, but it will not be a rerun, analysts and industry executives insist
in one apartment, a couple who contribute to environmental causes and have no children could be shown an ad for a compact car
today, including satellite tv and cable providers, nearly 40 million set-top boxes are <unk> <unk> representing about a third of american households
so, for example, two households in new york, living in next-door apartments, could watch, say, <unk> good <unk> and see different ads
ferber of <unk> said, <unk> these digital companies are so huge and so powerful, they are going to be hard to resist
the tv networks and local stations, analysts say, refused to put the ad inventory they hold for marketers on the google marketplace
<unk> traditional tv model is breaking <unk> said laura desmond, chief executive of <unk> <unk> one of the <unk> largest <unk> companies
in addition, digital recording services, now offered by cable and satellite tv operators, allow programs to be recorded for later viewing
so data brokers and <unk> companies, including <unk> experian and <unk> are also suppliers to the emerging industry of digital tv
but it has proved to be a <unk> marketplace, with the biggest winners being the internet ad giants google and facebook
desmond of <unk> <unk> for example, expects a wrenching consolidation in the media business over the next three years or so
nail of forrester, is for a tv viewing experience less cluttered with irrelevant ads and <unk> improved results for tv advertisers
<unk> <unk> but predicting the winners in the <unk> high-tech migration to digital tv, analysts and executives agree, is uncertain
the most recent evidence surfaced in august, when one major media company after another reported weaker television advertising revenue
it is the kind of video environment, they say, that delivers the sight, sound and emotion that drive decision-making
for advertisers, the long-term goal is to be able to reach ideal customers for their products, on any screen
by contrast, advertising on cable and broadcast television is expected to inch ahead at 1 percent annually
last year, <unk> mediavest did an <unk> tv ad campaign for <unk> acura <unk> luxury sedan
for advertisers, this should mean more productive ads and the ability to scientifically test their effectiveness
<unk> <unk> the peril and promise are byproducts of <unk> truly becoming a digital medium
the only three sure survivors, she said, are disney, 21st century fox and comcast nbcuniversal
<unk> a medium becomes <unk> at the household level, <unk> the data <unk> he said
with advanced software and data-mining technology, the potential for tailoring ads can be quite refined
on the web, some newspaper and magazine publishers have built sizable digital ad businesses
<unk> video sellers have greater power to dictate how the new technology rolls out
the big media companies have used that scarcity to deflect competition in the past
they provide software expertise and consulting services and often match buyers and sellers
<unk> for example, has demographic, shopping and lifestyle information on every american household
even those who insist the tv market is unique have their qualms
desmond said, may well include the internet <unk> like google and facebook
the firm combined <unk> sales data and other data to choose 1
the technology for digital tv is still in its early stages
<unk> is so central to the <unk> and <unk> strategy
<unk> both a crisis and a huge opportunity
smaller players will most likely be bought up
for finely tailored ads, data is crucial
