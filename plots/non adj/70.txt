injury prevention may get one of the biggest boosts because global public health leaders have often ignored injuries as health risks, focusing instead on major diseases

individual countries can see in what areas <unk> leading or lagging, often for the first time, then look to peers for advice or vice versa
if public health leaders are to catch up on accident prevention, the global burden of disease study findings can help them see where and how
