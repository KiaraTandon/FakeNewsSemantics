a person who is five feet tall has a 30 percent greater chance of developing heart disease than someone who is 5 feet 6, said a lead author of the new study, sir <unk> <unk> a professor of cardiology at the university of leicester in england
since then, experts have noted that shorter people are more likely to get heart disease in a variety of populations and ethnic groups, even after accounting for such risk factors as smoking and cholesterol, diabetes and obesity
but genetic variations are distributed at random in populations, and genes are not affected by lifestyle or environmental factors that have to be accounted for when researchers analyze data they get by simply observing populations
height was just a marker for some other problem causing heart disease, most scientists said <unk> perhaps a poor diet, or infectious diseases in childhood that led to a lifelong weakness of the heart
he observed that 97 men and three women who had a heart attack before age 40 and were admitted to massachusetts general hospital were two inches shorter on average than 146 healthy men
no one was more surprised by the result than heart disease experts, although they have known about a purported association between height and heart disease for more than half a century
to the surprise of researchers who had thought the very notion a joke, an international consortium of investigators reported on wednesday that shorter stature increases the risk of heart disease
<unk> and his colleagues realized that if there was a real link, genetic variations that resulted in short stature would also result in a greater risk of heart disease
of course, the increased risk pales in comparison to that caused by smoking, which elevates the odds of getting heart disease by 200 to 300 percent
there is nothing people can do about their height, but the researchers hope the finding will lead to the discovery of new links to heart disease
kari <unk> chief executive of decode genetics, said the increase in heart disease risk was real but so small as to be not very meaningful
the rest, the researchers speculated, may come from poorly understood mechanisms, governed by height genes, that control the development of both blood vessels and bones

until now, the only way to do that was through large, expensive and time-consuming randomized controlled clinical trials

until recently, heart disease research focused on factors that greatly increase risk, like cholesterol levels
of course, no randomized trial can test whether height is linked to heart disease risk
