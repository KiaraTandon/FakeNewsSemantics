if you judge team <unk> year solely based on results, it would be safe to say that the team he hand-picked after the 2014 season to go on a run for an olympic berth in 2018 is hitting its stride as the foursome settles in to defend their provincial title
we won a grand slam, a canada cup win that secured a spot for the olympic trials, and <unk> won a couple other events and <unk> just played <unk> said koe, who sits second on the world curling tour money list with <unk> in earnings
