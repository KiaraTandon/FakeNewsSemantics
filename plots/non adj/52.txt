one clever drill is to put food in a bowl, then place a colander over the bowl and tape the two pieces together
how do we get him to be more <unk> part of training a dog to understand a command involves drilling for clarity
how can i get him to come <unk> it is not surprising that many dogs choose play over coming when called
the dog learns that <unk> is not the end of their fun, but an opportunity to earn more free time
this teaches dogs to focus more carefully on the words and to associate them with the correct actions
if the dog has learned that <unk> means run, choose a new word like <unk> and start over
use a leash or long line to prevent the dog from grabbing the bowl and dashing off
when out with other dogs in the green space, it seems like he deliberately runs away
at the dog park, he will not come until he has played for a few minutes
if we are not careful, the word <unk> can start to mean <unk> time to leave
if the dog is at the right grade level, they might hesitate, but they should listen
it is no wonder they will not come when called when playing with another dog
use more free play as a reward for coming away from other dogs during play
the dog will be able to see and smell the food but not reach it
use special treats, fun, games and anything else that is good in your <unk> world
too many people jump from easy recalls to the dog park without intermediary steps
reward them with a treat and then send them back to sniff some more
if a dog likes sniffing trees for <unk> call them away from a tree
treats might not trump play but there are ways to get past this
during play, there is a cost to coming when <unk> the fun stops
we grumble if disturbed during a good hockey game or favourite television show
my daughter has a four-year-old dog that will not consistently come when called
children show obvious dejection and dawdle when asked to leave a party
when we say sit, he bounces between sitting and lying down
make every effort to ensure this word leads to positive experiences
they might need a moment to diffuse a situation before obeying
sometimes our dogs feel trapped by other dogs in their space
many dogs cannot come away from a piece of food
this means that sit means sit and down means down
stay helps them learn to hold position firmly when correct
some dogs take silence as an indication they were wrong
practise calling your dog away from this tempting distraction
only reward responses that are correct the first time
carry this lesson up through to the dog park
use activities that your dog loves as a reward
the leap in skill level is too great
that is like going from kindergarten to university
the term used by trainers is stimulus control
finally, if you cannot beat them, join them
be generous to a fault at this stage
that is not positive for social creatures
we all want to prolong the fun
next, drill various distractions in controlled environments
ask them to perform skills they know
do give a little bit of leeway
make sure to teach stay as well
in our yard, he comes to me
our dog confuses sit with down
do not reward incorrect responses
dogs are no different
we make similar decisions
play training games
