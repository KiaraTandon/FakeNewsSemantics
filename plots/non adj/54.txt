<unk> <unk> a professor in the school of veterinary medicine at <unk> university, wrote that he believes that the differences in gaze between dogs and wolves means <unk> dogs have acquired this superior ability during the evolutionary and domestication process of living with humans
japanese researchers found that dogs who trained a long gaze on their owners had elevated levels of <unk> a hormone produced in the brain that is associated with nurturing and attachment, similar to the feel-good feedback that bolsters bonding between parent and child
<unk> unique about this study is that it demonstrates that <unk> can boost social gaze interaction between two very different <unk> said steve chang, an assistant professor of psychology and neurobiology at yale who was not involved in this latest research
<unk> a way, domesticated dogs could hijack our social circuits, and we can hijack their social <unk> he said in an email, as each species learned how to raise the <unk> <unk> levels, facilitating connection
and when researchers gave dogs extra <unk> through a nasal spray, the female dogs (though not the <unk> gazed at their owners even longer, which in turn boosted the <unk> <unk> levels
unlike dogs, wolves <unk> to use eye contact as a <unk> and are inclined to <unk> human eye <unk> wrote <unk> <unk> a study author and research fellow at <unk> medical university
chang, who studies <unk> in animals, noted that through <unk> dogs came to regard humans as their <unk> social <unk> while humans also came to view dogs as social partners
<unk> she noted that it raised many intriguing questions: about long and short <unk> why only female dogs reacted to the <unk> <unk> whether other breeds would yield different results
the changes in <unk> were most pronounced in dogs who fixed longer gazes on their owners, which researchers defined as 100 seconds in the first five minutes of the encounter
alexandra horowitz, director of the dog cognition lab at barnard college, called the study <unk> fascinating direction of research, because it looks at connections between behavioral measures and hormonal components
the <unk> gaze cues connection and response in the owner, who will reward the dog by gazing, talking and touching, all of which helps <unk> the two, the researchers said
(a view endorsed by this owner of a havanese, whose eager, soulful gaze is both long and <unk> punctuated by cocking his head, and fluttering his ears forward
but now, only the female dogs who were given the <unk> displayed an even longer gaze at their owners, who in turn had spikes in their <unk> levels
<unk> <unk> he continued: <unk> is a possibility that dogs cleverly and unknowingly utilized a natural system meant for bonding a parent with his or her child
<unk> <unk> in the first experiment, researchers measured <unk> levels in the urine of 30 owners and dogs before and after they interacted for 30 minutes
maclean, co-director of the duke canine cognition center and a co-author of a commentary accompanying the study, said, <unk> <unk> know what the <unk> gaze means
but they speculated that vigilance in male dogs, set off by the presence of the two strangers, may have moderated the effects of <unk>
maclean said, <unk> everyone was speaking a language i <unk> understand, and i knew i could never acquire their language, <unk> just give up
the researchers also tested wolves raised by humans to see whether a <unk> gaze would raise <unk> levels in either or both
maclean, an evolutionary anthropologist, said that fundamentally, for dogs, human behavior is <unk> telltale of everything that is about to happen
<unk> are we going to stand or sit? leave the room? bring food? <unk> and so they stare at us, fixedly
but pointing to the small size of the sample, she added, <unk> <unk> know how it proves the domestication thesis
the breeds included golden retrievers, standard poodles, miniature dachshunds, miniature schnauzers, a jack russell terrier, and two mixed breed
they suggest that dogs became domesticated in part by adapting to a primary human means of contact: eye-to-eye communication
that continuous loop of loving reinforcement may begin with the <unk> gaze, according to a new report in science
but compared with dogs, the wolves scarcely gazed at their owners, and the <unk> <unk> levels barely budged
dog owners may ascribe similar complexity to their <unk> gaze, certain that they, like parents, can interpret it
they saw no significant difference in <unk> levels among the breeds or sex of the dogs
in the second experiment, researchers administered nasal sprays of either saline or <unk> to dogs
this time, each dog entered a room with three humans: its owner and two strangers
other experts on canine behavior expressed caution about overstating the implications of this study
) <unk> your <unk> gaze helps you think your dog understands <unk> said dr
<unk> <unk> and then there is the meaning of a <unk> <unk>
after receiving those long gazes, the <unk> levels of <unk> increased, too
maybe the dogs are hugging you with their <unk> <unk> but dr
and as those big browns remain fixed on you, the tail wags
<unk> not reluctant to tune in to us at every moment
researchers could not say why the sex of the dog mattered
when you look at a human baby, it feels good
they also measured <unk> in five wolves and their owners
the dogs were males and females, <unk> neutered and intact
maybe dogs gaze at you because it feels good
those big brown eyes gaze at you, deeply
<unk> the human gaze is layered with nuance
<unk> i was dropped on <unk> dr
you caress, murmuring sweet nothings

horowitz, <unk> produces bonding
in an email, dr
