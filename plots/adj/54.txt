according to the standstill hypothesis, the ancestors of native americans would have built up a large degree of genetic diversity in the thousands of years they were confined to <unk> <unk> more so than if these populations had migrated directly from siberia to the americas
the genetic material is not only among the oldest ever found in the americas, but also the first ancient dna discovered in <unk> the region around the bering strait where many researchers believe asians first settled before spreading through north and south america
the fact that two children who died at roughly the same time in the same community shared so few genes is consistent with the idea that the population was prevented from moving into the americas for thousands of years, dr
<unk> who was not involved in the new study, thought the new dna was too recent to provide proof of the idea that humans were trapped in <unk> for thousands of years
in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, the researchers reported that they had recovered dna from two skeletons of children who lived in alaska 11,500 years ago
<unk> opened up new ecological zones that were being <unk> by plants and <unk> said dennis <unk> of the university of utah, a co-author of the new study
after the baby and the fetus died, their bodies were carefully laid atop a bed of red <unk> surrounded by antlers fashioned into hunting darts
<unk> valuable information, but <unk> a little bit late to be extremely informative to let us know if the <unk> standstill hypothesis <unk> he said
humans were able to thrive in <unk> because even at the height of the last ice age, the region was not covered by glaciers
but the two children died after the glaciers melted, he noted, and their settlement <unk> well be a remnant of that original <unk> group
researchers have long wondered how people settled the americas, particularly the path they took to the new territory and the timing of their expansion
many of the sites where people lived may now be impossible to reach, because sea levels rose at the end of the ice age
but now scientists have begun extracting dna from human bones, and the findings are providing new glimpses at the history of the first americans
in 2007, <unk> <unk> of the university of illinois and his colleagues proposed a model for this migration, known as the <unk> standstill
potter and his colleagues drilled small pieces of bone from the two skeletons and sent them to geneticists at the university of utah
they might have had the same father, or they might have belonged to different families who suffered terrible losses at the same time
one of the buried children was an infant who died a few months after <unk> the other was likely a late-term fetus
because each cell can contain hundreds of <unk> it is easier to reconstruct their dna than that of the cellular nuclei
<unk> things we hardly ever find <unk> <unk> a very rare window into the worldview of these <unk> said ben a
the researchers can only speculate how an infant and a fetus from different mothers ended up in the same grave
excavations there have revealed that between <unk> and 8,000 years ago, people visited during the summer, catching salmon and hares
but the <unk> energy factories, called <unk> also carry small bits of their own dna inherited solely from our mothers
more conclusive findings would be possible if scientists found older dna from people who lived during the <unk> standstill
but the significance of the dna found at upward sun river extends far beyond the story of two children
on monday, researchers at the university of alaska and elsewhere published an important addition to the growing genetic archive
early <unk> expanded east into <unk> about 25,000 years ago, they proposed, and stayed there for about 10,000 years
potter, an archaeologist at the university of alaska fairbanks who has led the research at upward sun river
humans could not expand eastward into the rest of the americas because they were blocked by glaciers
<unk> i think <unk> probably unlikely, largely because a lot of <unk> is now under water
below the hearth, the team discovered a burial pit containing the skeletons of two other children
until recently, archaeologists studying these questions were limited mostly to digging up skeletons and artifacts
but why the two bodies ended up in the same grave is impossible to know
the infant and the fetus did not share the same mother or even maternal grandmother
the utah geneticists focused their search on mitochondrial dna in the upward sun river bones
about 15,000 years ago, as the glaciers retreated, the standstill came to an end
the vast majority of our dna lies in the nucleus of the cell
with the consent of native american tribes that live around the site, dr
it was mainly tundra and shrub land, with scattered stands of trees
in 2011, archaeologists discovered cremated bones on a hearth at the site
archaeologists are now looking for skeletons from that age, but dr
the archaeological site, near upward sun river, was discovered in 2010
it sheds light on how people first moved into the americas
they built <unk> structures where they made fires and slept
<unk> are archaeologists up there looking for such <unk> dr
it may give us a snapshot of that earlier time
research revealed that the bones belonged to a 3-year-old child
they succeeded in recovering mitochondrial dna from both bone samples
but to their surprise, the genes were markedly different
clearly, the children had been ceremonially buried
<unk> is not holding his breath
