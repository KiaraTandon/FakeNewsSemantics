when 53-year-old denise hobson first heard about the standard animal agriculture practice of <unk> <unk> by which female chickens are deprived of food and light for up to two weeks in order to artificially jolt their weary bodies into producing more eggs, she was at first appalled - and then
oops, there goes another one right now! did you hear <unk> in fact, denise believes that her ovulation has been so amped-up by the process of forced molting that she will actually have eggs left over after her pregnancy is complete - eggs which she hopes to sell to a
realizing, however, that ingesting copious amounts of cheap beer might not be improving her fertility (although it did seem to improve her chances of having casual <unk> denise has since abandoned her <unk> molting <unk> in favor of her windowless manhattan apartment - which, she says, bears a marked similarity
<unk> and so, beginning six months ago, denise embarked upon her own self-created program of forced - or in her case, voluntarily induced - <unk> going weeks at a time without food or natural light in order to jolt her body into ovulating outside its normal cycle
a tender smile appearing on her face, she remarks, <unk> too soon to start thinking about my kid's college fund, <unk> clearly, this middle-aged manhattan <unk> is already thinking like a mother hen
they're frail, <unk> bald - utterly pathetic! and it occurred to me that if forced molting works for them, why shouldn't it work for me, too? i'm in much better shape
although she is not yet pregnant, she is confident that it is only a matter of time before her <unk> combination of forced molting and casual sex results in pregnancy
as a <unk> woman, she was all too aware that her ovulation was becoming increasingly sporadic and that her body was producing fewer and fewer eggs
that being said, the forced molting process has not been a walk in the park, says denise - not by any stretch of the imagination
denise, a single woman living in new york city, explained that she has been trying unsuccessfully to get pregnant since the age of 49
then, just when she thought that she might have to relinquish her <unk> of becoming a middle-aged mom, denise learned about forced molting
however, she figured that she would compensate for her decreased fertility simply by increasing the frequency of her unprotected sexual encounters
for one, she'd thought that she'd found the ideal forced molting site in her favorite dark, dingy, <unk> neighborhood <unk>
for one, she found that as she approached middle age, she had fewer and fewer opportunities for casual sex
she's found it highly encouraging that, just as molting hens lose their feathers, she has lost all her hair
he recommended expensive fertility treatments, in which eggs from younger, more fertile donors would be implanted into her uterus
and not only that, the casual encounters she did manage to have were less than satisfying
<unk> other <unk> she summarized <unk> <unk> sex has been increasingly hard to come by
<unk> i first saw the conditions of those <unk> she said, <unk> couldn't believe it
<unk> the <unk> denise initially turned to her ob-gyn for help in getting pregnant
<unk> and dozens of eggs, dropping down into my uterus by the day
unfortunately, recounted denise, that plan didn't work out so well
however, denise couldn't afford the pricey procedure
<unk> can feel the <unk> she <unk>
the big question, of course, is
is it working? denise thinks so
in every sense
