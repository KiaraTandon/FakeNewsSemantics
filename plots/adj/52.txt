<unk> was just tough luck, it goes off a <unk> skate and bounces the other way and then hits him in the <unk> vancouver gm jim benning said
<unk> though we had lost a few, we had played pretty good in those games, we were confident that we were still there in the hunt
they are 50-50 or <unk> so 40 per cent of the people are going to think you are wrong one way or the other
sutter and <unk> were sent home wednesday after suffering injuries in the second period of tuesday <unk> 3-1 win over the colorado avalanche
they <unk> be back any time soon and desjardins did not try and pretend that the loss of the two veterans <unk> hurt
<unk> does make it a much bigger <unk> the vancouver canucks coach said before his team played the arizona coyotes on wednesday night
now everybody is back, <unk> had a couple of games, so <unk> no reason we <unk> start playing the way we can play
<unk>  ice <unk> the canucks recalled defenceman yannick weber and winger alex friesen from their ahl affiliate in utica
<unk>  they come, of course, at the worst possible time for the canucks, who had finally got completely healthy
you can go either way and after the game, if you lose, well, you should have gone the other way
he is a good player and <unk> miss him, but we are going to have to figure it out
he has got a visor on and it just hits underneath his visor and hits him in the jaw
you have to battle and you have to stay in it until you come back and get healthy again
<unk> willie desjardins did not even try to <unk> the loss of defenceman alex <unk> and centre brandon sutter

desjardins said before the game he feared a possible match up against coyotes centre martin <unk>
as expected, alex <unk> a healthy scratch for the last two games, stepped in for <unk>
<unk> he gets matched up against hanzal, <unk> a tough matchup for a <unk> desjardins said
he also said he sometimes <unk> himself when decisions he makes <unk> result in a win
it is going to happen, but i think <unk> probably a better matchup at home
<unk> trying to do what is best for the player and best for the team
<unk>  mccann was inserted into the lineup when dorsett was unable to play
but <unk> initial plan was to play adam <unk> instead of rookie jared mccann
i am the first to say, well, that <unk> the way to go
<unk> draw man, two guys who are on the first unit (power play)
that would have been three straight games for mccann as a healthy scratch
<unk> not like <unk> a 90-10 decision, they are not clear cut
<unk> are difficult injuries in all facets of our <unk> desjardins said
if you lose, you wished you would have tried something else
but that is the way we are going to go tonight
i think the team was excited, the team felt that way
the guys that were injured had played a couple of games
i <unk> know what else you can say about it
they will join the team at <unk> practice in vancouver
sutter has a broken jaw, <unk> a fractured fibula
