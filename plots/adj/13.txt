for not cutting the pill costs and for being rich, bernie sanders is throwing karl <unk> book at martin <unk> the big pharma executive who is responsible for a <unk> price hike and who also donated $2,700 to sanders in an attempt to bribe his way out of this
this will teach the people that under bernie sanders presidency capitalist crimes will not be ignored, that those who are not spreading the wealth shall be severely punished, and that no one can be allowed to own or run any company outside of the state
every progressive watching this was screaming on the inside, <unk> him in jail and transfer the company to the <unk> and if you didn't scream this on the inside, you are not progressive enough, just like hillary clinton
martin <unk> had the audacity to challenge sanders to a public debate, to which sanders responded by challenging <unk> to a show trial
<unk> has not responded to our questions on twitter, either blocking or ignoring them, even though we thought our questions were extremely equal
it is, however, too late for this entrepreneurial <unk> sanders is so disgusted with martin <unk> he doesn't rule out capital punishment
at a congressional hearing, he smiled too many times at the democrats and <unk> shamelessly quoting the useless and outdated u
<unk> first, he has profited from the poor and the unfortunate, and second, he owns a company
join the collective to get a front row ticket to the show trial while supply <unk>
that was his biggest <unk> it is not advisable to ignore supporters of the progressive cause
no one should be fooled by this evil capitalist pig's <unk> support
constitution in front of our representatives
