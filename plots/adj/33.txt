and you have to suspect with bc already in campaign mode ahead of an election in may of 2017, whenever clark takes aim at her ndp opposition at home, the ndp here is going to get caught in the cross fire
the ndp has been in power less than a year and if the word <unk> is used at all these days it refers to the sound of our economy being blown apart by the depressed price of oil
critics of the alberta government immediately took to social media to declare the ndp has made such a mess of things that the bc government is fed up and speaking out
that takes us back to christy <unk> throne speech that made a point of saying <unk> carbon tax <unk> a truly <unk> tax <unk> not an opportunistic reach into <unk> wallets
<unk> talking here of a system introduced by previous pc governments and so it was easy on wednesday for the new ndp government to happily point the finger of blame backwards
but the bc speech clearly bothered <unk> government enough that it sent out economic development minister deron bilous to drive home the point that the ndp was never the intended target
<unk>  that had observers wondering if clark was taking a swipe at premier rachel <unk> carbon tax but, again, ben chin in <unk> office says <unk> <unk> the target
<unk> have a good working relationship with the <unk> government and think <unk> very important for us to work together for the benefit of <unk> and british <unk>
by referring to <unk> and the <unk> the speech was shooting at former progressive conservative governments that were in power for decades during boom times
(in an interview, spokesman ben chin with <unk> office said the reference to alberta was indeed looking to the past, not the <unk>
reports from the auditor general can be so laden with <unk> it would be easier to literally eat some chapters than read them
bashing alberta pc <unk> became a theme of sorts on wednesday with the release of the latest report from <unk> auditor general
but it turns out the government <unk> keep track of the program to see if <unk> actually making or losing money
<unk>  i have never heard of a throne speech taking aim at another provincial government in such a negative way
the issue he addresses first deals with the <unk> royalty reduction programs that, in the 2014-15 fiscal year, handed out $1
4 billion in royalty reductions so that energy companies would pump out oil and gas that would otherwise be <unk>
<unk> expected their resource boom never to end, failed to diversify their economy and lost control of government spending
but there was something else on wednesday that appeared to point the finger directly at the new alberta government
<unk> interpret this as an attack on the previous government and their failure to diversify the <unk> said bilous
this new document is no exception but <unk> saher also provided plenty of meat amongst the linguistic gristle
the idea being the province would ultimately benefit from increased royalties from the extra oil and gas
on tuesday evening, reading from a throne speech written by the government of christy clark, lt
<unk> a bit like using the queen to take out a hit on your neighbour
<unk>  but the mix up between the ndp there and here is understandable
in this case, bc was raising alberta as a cautionary tale about government overspending
<unk> really aimed across the floor at our (ndp) <unk> said chin
now, british columbia has introduced the drive-by throne speech
judith <unk> hit the gas pedal and took aim
in politics, there are drive-by smears and drive-by insults
<unk> the decades, alberta lost its <unk> said <unk>
but <unk> not what the speech said
<unk>
