last friday, buzzfeed reported twitter planned on changing timelines, moving away from a <unk> structure (most recent tweets at the top) to an algorithm that would examine who you follow and pick the best tweets you missed
<unk> an earlier <unk> i mention this is connected to twitter's while you were away feature, which highlights important tweets you may have missed while away from the service
frankly, it's difficult to tell when the algorithm has made any changes, but that could vary depending on how many accounts you follow and other activity
users of the social network had worried an algorithm would ruin their feeds, swapping the service's rapid fire feel for something more like a facebook feed
users may first notice a message on their timeline that reads <unk> miss an important <unk> letting them know the feature is available
the change is here, and judging from an early look at <unk> twitter, it's certainly not as bad as previously thought
the only real way to tell is by viewing the <unk> on a tweet to tell if they've been <unk>
twitter ceo jack dorsey later commented timelines would stay as they are and professed his love for <unk> live stream
<unk> on tuesday it announced the changes, which it calls <unk> miss important tweets from people you follow
on mobile, you go to settings and look for timeline or timeline personalization to shut it off
<unk>  now that the timelines are rolling out, they're nowhere near as bad as many feared
on the web, twitter users go to settings, then account, then the content section to disable
basically, the algorithm will move older tweets that it deems valuable higher up on the timeline
that fretting reached a fever pitch over the weekend, spawning the popular hashtag <unk>
if this is how twitter's algorithm functions, turning it off might not be necessary
before we dig into the new timeline, let's quickly recap how this all started
now if we can just get twitter to add that edit button
users finding it disruptive can shut it off
twitter timelines are going to be just fine
outrage, well at least on twitter, was fierce
stop etching the grave stones
that's not correct
delete the eulogies
it's subtle
