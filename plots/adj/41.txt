<unk> would i come up there <unk>  as the only white house correspondent who watched obama launch his political career here in 1997, people ask me all the time: what did people think of him back then? did he take the place by <unk> when did you realize he
in conversations wednesday in his private cabin on air force one as he flew to springfield <unk> a native son returning to his political roots <unk> and then later in a chat with three former legislators, obama said that while <unk> political culture has grown meaner and more partisan, he
he made clear he missed the anonymity of being a backbencher in a prairie capital, the days when he could drive his beat-up jeep to the diary queen and, as he joked, build up a college fund for his daughters, malia and sasha, by fleecing his colleagues in poker
as i traveled and talked with obama on his return to springfield, i realized how much his anonymity worked for him then <unk> and how it informed his view that americans are not as divided as our politics would suggest
<unk>  after he first entered the white house in 2009, he said, <unk> would invite a number of republican <unk> to come over to the white house for movies or some other events
it was also a time when, his friends agreed, he could bring warring political factions together in <unk> to strike a deal, when he <unk> lampooned or lionized by people who <unk> know him
when he sat down with three old friends <unk> former senators who showed him the ropes in springfield <unk> he talked about all they got done outside the public spotlight
<unk> <unk> go up to the floor to hear him speak when he was a <unk> said the veteran, who listened to obama's speech from the basement press room
after he got to washington, he recalled, <unk> had very good relationships and friendships with some of the same people now who <unk> take a picture with me
from the gilded balcony of the cathedral-like house chambers, i phoned an old reporter friend from when we both covered the community organizer turned state senator
i came to know him, but only because my newspaper, the chicago tribune, was devoted to uncovering flaws in the illinois capital justice system
still, it took years me to realize he might one day rise in politics <unk> possibly even to mayor of the city of chicago
<unk>  but increasingly, he complained, <unk> was hard for them to do it without getting in <unk> with others in the gop
a liberal black lawmaker from <unk> <unk> he want to vent about the system? especially to his hometown <unk>  he dug in
obama also won bipartisan support for a bill to make police more aware of the role that race may play in law enforcement
<unk> accosted him with a tape recorder to ask about his closed-door meetings with law enforcement officials to talk about racial profiling
and that insight came only after democrats took the majority in the state senate and he began to call some shots
he was just a new lawmaker in the minority party with zero involvement in the hidden machinations of the capitol
<unk>  i listened as they reminisced about passing state laws to reform campaign finance and capital justice
president obama was addressing the illinois general assembly, but the dogged statehouse press corps was not there
he smiled and said <unk> let me know when he had something to tell me
the truth is few in the statehouse took note of obama during his years here
i suddenly recalled a moment with obama outside the statehouse press room, sometime in 2002
obama, a constitutional lawyer who also focused on the problem, was valuable to us
so the longer the game went on, the looser their betting <unk> he claimed
his secret? <unk> would just nurse my beer and these guys <unk> you know
<unk> took them for all they were <unk> he boasted to laughter
they fostered friendships, discussed their daughters and looked for common ground
they <unk> become punching bags on cable news or talk radio
he kept a low profile for most of his eight years
<unk> talk to me, i remember him saying, but not then
<unk> the same guy now that i was then
i stormed off to talk to somebody else
<unk>  he added, <unk> no more cynical
<unk> not like <unk> <unk> he said
someone who was going places
it <unk> like i changed
my positions are surprisingly consistent
<unk> not more ideological
i pressed
