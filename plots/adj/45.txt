even with minority ownership of 40 per cent, the government stresses it would be the largest single shareholder of hydro one, with other owners limited to 10 per cent <unk> key decisions will require a two-thirds vote by the board, giving the province an effective <unk> and the government retains
<unk> as my star colleague robert <unk> first reported last month, the government is quietly buying off the influential power <unk> union with a sweetheart deal to win their support by giving its members shares in the new entity
what difference does that make? in recent years, the liberals have ordered hydro one to install expensive smart meters in all ontario homes, and asked the utility to speed up transmission links to wind turbines or solar panels
by obsessing over price points, these critics are missing the larger point that electricity costs are strictly controlled under law <unk> the ontario energy board sets rates, not hydro one, and it has a record of refusing increases
facing stiff public opposition to road tolls and other tax hikes, the government opted for an asset swap <unk> with the result that hydro one is being cannibalized to put flesh on the bare bones of transit infrastructure
would a privatized hydro one make future investments in transmission links to hydro quebec should it be in the public interest? the government insists it will find a way, it just <unk> tell us precisely how
<unk> last month, <unk> panel executed a spectacular <unk> recommending the sale of 60 per cent of hydro one because, when it came to <unk> ownership, we did not find the case compelling
what are we giving up in control of transmission lines to gain new transit lines? the potential risk would be worth taking only if wynne had exhausted all other options
she is using that majority to impose privatization of hydro one on us rather than introduce new revenue measures, because our electricity utility offers the path of least resistance
a government-appointed panel on privatization, headed by <unk> bank chief executive ed clark, concluded last november that <unk> one transmission should remain in public ownership as a core asset
amid the hydro one hyperbole and hypocrisy <unk> the liberals and progressive conservatives keep reversing stances <unk> <unk> the good, the bad, the ugly, and the reality on electricity
both decisions resulted in higher rates, which is why critics of privatization downplay the issue of public policy (or contradict themselves by pretending that <unk> all about price)
the liberals are using their majority to rush the sale without providing the fine print on secret deals with the unions, or protection of the public interest
in a speech last week, energy minister bob <unk> talked about future legislation that would <unk> the <unk> right to prioritize critical transmission infrastructure
rather than an asset swap that shortchanges the public interest, wynne should have fought harder to bolster transit revenues to meet her cash shortfall
the liberals have refused to provide details on their secret undertakings to the powerful union, which has since dropped its opposition to any privatization
<unk> when a pc government undervalued the asset, overpaid for transaction fees, and allowed the private owners to jack up tolls at will
by contrast, the board of the partially privatized entity will have a fiduciary obligation to seek the highest profits for its new shareholders
as sole owner today, the government operates hydro one in the public interest <unk> and pockets roughly $800 million a year in profit
true, the pcs and ndp teamed up during the minority government years to oppose taxes and tolls, but she now has a majority
wynne and clark argue they need the money from privatization to invest in other public assets, notably transit and transportation infrastructure
oh, and <unk> be misled by opposition politicians and major unions that have lapsed into scaremongering about price gouging
for a premier who places a premium on conversations, consultations and consensus, the proposed sale is a done deal
clark and wynne argue that failing to make critical infrastructure investments in transit would be a missed economic opportunity
<unk> cabinet could <unk> key transmission <unk> for first nations, the ring of fire, or electricity trade with quebec
the government promises to retain substantial control of hydro one, keep transaction costs low, and act transparently
they are right about the opportunity costs, but wrong about the political opportunism that underlies their calculations
<unk> clark and wynne insist they have learned lessons from the 1999 fire sale of hwy
wynne is pushing her privatization plan through the legislature with minimal discussion, leaving key questions unanswered
politics is the art of the possible <unk> and choosing the least bad option
now, she has gone against her own ideological instincts to privatize a public asset
to govern is to choose, and privatizing is nothing if not a bold choice
both were examples of elected governments imposing legitimate public policy obligations on hydro one
the more vexing question is how private profit will prevail over public purpose
the false spectre of high electricity rates generates more heat than light
the early criticism of wynne was that she <unk> make tough decisions
selling hydro one is no ordinary sales job for kathleen wynne
while privatization is unpopular, taxation is even more unpopular
<unk> fine as far as it goes
it just <unk> go far enough
yet the privatization proceeds apace
just not bold enough
details to come
but she <unk>
