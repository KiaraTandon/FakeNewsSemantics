in 2014, as few as 58 per cent of ets buses arrived at key timing points between five minutes early and one minute late, although the goal is for them to meet this standard 90 per cent of the time, says a new city <unk> report
the latest figures show while some centres always met the proper arrival times, 19 of them were off schedule at least half the time for one period of the day, and one site only met the target for 18 per cent of trips
<unk> management advised us that they believe the decline in performance is a reflection of an increase in the number of persons with mobility devices and strollers, construction activity and increased traffic congestion on city <unk> city auditor david <unk> wrote
the best months of the year for bus reliability are june to august <unk> 74 per cent of the fleet was on time in this period in 2012, dropping to 69 per cent in 2014
there were <unk> incidents such as loitering, liquor infractions, disturbances, misconduct and smoking reported by transit and downtown peace officers in 2014, up 61 per cent from the <unk> incidents reported two years earlier
although passenger surveys showed a slight drop in satisfaction with personal safety from 2014 to 2015, at least 75 per cent of respondents still felt safe waiting or riding on ets vehicles
<unk>  the problem was also seen at <unk> 26 transit centres, where average on-time arrivals went down to 60 per cent from 63 per cent between 2012 and 2014
although <unk> concluded ets operations are being run efficiently and economically compared to other cities, he found a major jump in the amount of disorder being reported
however, that year there were an estimated <unk> people left at the side of the road by buses that were too crowded to carry anyone else
the system never came close to meeting the standard from 2012 to 2015 and performance, instead dropped steadily, figures in the report released thursday indicate
the worst months were from december to january, when reliability dropped from 60 per cent in 2012 to 58 per cent two years later
<unk> also advised us that the 2012 through 2015 operating budgets did not include funding to address schedule adherence and overload issues
at the same time, personal crimes, such as assault, uttering threats, robbery and sexual offences, rose 14 per cent, to 339
officials hope to reduce this problem with better scheduling, electronic <unk> cards and smart buses that provide real-time arrival information
ets officials believe the addition of 10 peace officers in 2010 contributed to the increased reporting, the report says
ets carried 89 million passengers in 2014, growing faster than <unk> rapid population increase
